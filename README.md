With this project, we aim to design our own online retail store
which includes inventory management and delivery system.In this
project we are creating an online retail of medicines and
products that can be found in a pharmacy. (For the reference of
grader, we plan to make a Database Management System similar to
applications like Netmeds,Pharmeasy).
The objective of this project is to record,store & manage the
details of various medical products, online orders, shipment and
users. We aim to build a project to ease the process of ordering
instant medicines with a simplistic UI.
This project is an insight into the design and implementation of
an online retail Pharmacy Management System.
The aim of this project is to develop software for the effective
management of a pharmaceutical store with a suitable backend to
deal with multiple requests along with proper monitoring.
The project provides proper control, storage, security and
administration over the online pharmaceutical stores.
